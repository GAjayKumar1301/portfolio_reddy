        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>1. Movie Recommendation System (May 30th - June 28th, 2022)
            During a one-month internship at Pantech Solutions, I worked on developing a "Movie Recommendation System" using machine learning techniques. The project involved analyzing user preferences and historical data to suggest movies that align with individual tastes. I applied algorithms to filter and predict user preferences, enhancing the user experience by providing personalized movie recommendations. This project honed my skills in data analysis, algorithm implementation, and Python programming, contributing to my understanding of how machine learning can be used in real-world applications.
            
            <br>2. Digital Image Processing (February 10th - June 30th, 2023)
            In a three-month internship focused on Digital Image Processing, I explored various techniques to process and analyze images for different applications. The project involved manipulating and enhancing digital images using algorithms that improved image quality, detected features, and performed object recognition. Throughout this internship, I gained hands-on experience with tools like MATLAB and OpenCV, and deepened my understanding of image processing concepts, including filtering, edge detection, and segmentation. This project strengthened my ability to work with complex data and apply theoretical knowledge to solve practical problems in image analysis.</p>
